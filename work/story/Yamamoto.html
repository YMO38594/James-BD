      <div class="scene-description">
        Within the inner sanctum of the First Division barracks sat a low table. Two steaming cups of lavender tea. Outside, the sky trembles — not from war, but the weight of what is to come.
      </div>

      <div class="action">[The All-Father and Yamamoto sit in stillness, cups between them. They place them down at the same time, the clink of porcelain echoing like a bell tolling fate.]</div>

      <div class="character all-father">THE ALL-FATHER</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"I am unstable." He wastes no time with pleasantries.</div>

      <div class="dialogue">"If left as I currently am, life itself will cease to exist."</div>

      <div class="action">No visible reaction from the Captain-Commander. Only the hardening of his eyes and the most minute fluctuation in his reiatsu betray his attention.</div>

      <div class="character all-father">THE ALL-FATHER</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"A... friend of mine devised a solution to this problem while I was in temporary stasis." He hesitates, then affirms the word. "Friend."</div>

      <div class="dialogue">"A ritual he designed either to fix me, or destroy me."</div>

      <div class="dialogue">"The ritual begins in three days and will last for nine. Coincidentally, the Quincy Blood War will also begin in three days and end on the ninth." A pause. "The last thing set to happen in three days... is your death."</div>

      <div class="character yamamoto">GENRYUSAI SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO</div>
      <div class="dialogue">(sipping his tea) "And you are telling me this because?"</div>

      <div class="action">The kind grandfather persona drops like a discarded haori. Before the All-Father now sits only the Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13.</div>

      <div class="character all-father">THE ALL-FATHER</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"Let's just say this is a bit of life insurance."</div>

      <div class="action">[He raises his hand. Space bends. Fire answers — but not as the world knows it. These flames whisper in tongues lost to the bones of giants. They threaten as much as they promise. He offers it to the Captain-Commander.]</div>

      <div class="action">Yamamoto instinctively reaches with his remaining right arm. The fire roars at him, demanding submission. And though this young godling had conjured many powers that would have left him befuddled, this was not one of them. This was fire. He knew it, he had tamed it for a thousand years. And he would do so again. In moments, he bends it to his will, demonstrating absolute mastery not just over the flames, but their very nature.</div>

      <div class="character all-father">THE ALL-FATHER</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"It is called Surtr. It was made to kill a god."</div>

      <div class="character yamamoto">GENRYUSAI SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"I see."</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"You made this to aid me kill a god?."</div>

      <div class="action">When the All-Father nods, Yamamoto shakes his head in disappointment.</div>

      <div class="character yamamoto">GENRYUSAI SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO</div>
      <div class="action">Conjuring Surtr, he uses his absolute authority over it and commands the power to snuff itself out... extinguishing all of its embers from existence.</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"Get someone else to do your dirty work. I will not have your blood on my hands."</div>

      <div class="character all-father">THE ALL-FATHER</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"How did you realize it?" Genuine curiosity colors his voice. "That <span class="flame-text">Surtr</span> was meant for me."</div>

      <div class="action">The old warrior lifts his cup with his right hand, the steam curling around his weathered face as he sips, lost in memory.</div>

      <div class="character yamamoto">GENRYUSAI SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"I have fought Yhwach. He is no god."</div>

      <div class="character all-father">THE ALL-FATHER</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"But you will still die in three days. Are you truly at peace with that?"</div>

      <div class="character yamamoto">GENRYUSAI SHIGEKUNI YAMAMOTO</div>
      <div class="dialogue">"If I die, so be it. Many have fallen by my hand. I do not fear falling to another's — so long as I take said hand with me."</div>

      <div class="action">The All-Father nods in understanding. He rises and disappears in a kaleidoscope of colors.</div>

      <div class="action">Yamamoto places his cup down with his left hand — an action so habitual he doesn't register the discrepancy until several seconds pass.</div>

      <div class="action">He turns his arm, tracing each scar and its associated memory, until he reaches one he doesn't recognize. A circular mark around his upper arm bearing a single word:</div>

      <div class="action" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.3rem; color: var(--gold); margin: 2rem 0;">'Enjoy!'</div>
